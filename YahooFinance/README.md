Hi Friends.
Lets do another web scraping project with Beautiful Soup, this time.
This was another task that I found at upwork and thought it would be fun to implement.

Problem Statement:
We need to create a script that can scrape the current price of a particular stock from yahoo finance website and store it in a text file. Simple!

Information provided by the client:
URL: "https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/QCGRIX"
Code names for the stocks to trace:
QCGRIX
SPY
VFIFX
FSRPX
FSPTX

Lets pickup one of the stocks and create the URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/QCGRIX
Lets hit the url and see how the price is stored by inspecting it.

We can use the name of the class to scrape the price information.
Lets see how ...


This was a simple attempt to sare how we can use Beautiful Soup to scrape data
THere are 100s of other options and ways, this was a simplest I could find and wanted to share for those who are just starting with python and web scraping
hope you liked it !!

Thanks for watching.
